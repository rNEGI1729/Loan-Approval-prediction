# Loan Approval Model using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

This repository contains a loan approval prediction model built using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The model is designed to predict whether a loan application will be approved or denied based on various features provided in the dataset. Due to the relatively small size of the dataset, the model's accuracy is not as high as it could be with a larger data sample. Nevertheless, the RNN model has achieved an accuracy of 78.86% on the test dataset.
